Knowing the problem and understanding
what drives it.

**02- Analyze the data** :
Performing the summary statistics
command enables to get to know
better the variables through statistics

deviation.

**03- Correlation Matrix** :
The Correlation Matrix allows 
to pick variables for the model.

**04- Training and Test Set** :
Create a training and test set with an
80/20 split. This allows an unbiased
assessment of the model.

**05- Multilinear Regression** :
now we are ready to create a multilinear
regression.

**06- Accuracy Assessment** :
Looking at the key metrics to
